                             The IMG package

This is the README file for the GAP package "IMG".

This package implements Iterated Monodromy groups.

This release (0.3.2) is a bug-fix release; it does not contain new features.
Some rough edges will still need to be smoothed. In particular,
the TODO file describes plans for future development, including
computations of presentations for self-similar groups, interval arithmetic
for complex dynamics, etc.

The package is distributed in source form, and does not require anything
else than a running GAP 4.5 or later. For updates, check

     https://github.com/gap-packages/img/

To use the package, start GAP and type

LoadPackage("IMG");

The "IMG" package banner should appear on the screen.

For details on how to use the IMG package, please consult the documentation.
It is available in the `doc' subdirectory (view the file `manual.pdf' via a PDF viewer).

An external module (DLL) provides floating-point functions used for complex
dynamics calculations. To compile it, first make sure that your system has a C
compiler. IMG needs some external libraries, but they are included
in the subdirectory `extern'. You may need to pass the appropriate `-with-cholmod`
option to the `./configure` script, telling it where the cholmod library/include is.
The options `--with-gaproot', `--with-gaparch' and
`CONFIGNAME' tell IMG where to look for the GAP installation; by default,
IMG searches for it in ../.. and /usr/local/src/gap.

In all cases, then run

'./configure && make' in IMG's root directory.
